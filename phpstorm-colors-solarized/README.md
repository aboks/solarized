Installation
------------

### Option 1: Install using "Import Settings..."

1. Go to `File | Import Settings...` and specify the `intellij-colors-solarized` directory.
 Clik `OK` in the dialog that appears.

2. Restart IntelliJ IDEA

3. Go to `Preferences | Editor | Colors & Fonts` and select one of the new 
color themes.

### Option 2: Manual installation

1.  Copy `Solarized Dark.xml` and `Solarized Light.xml` to your PhpStorm preferences:
On Windows it is in `C:\Users\<username>\.WebIde40\config\colors`.
        
2. Restart PhpStorm

3. Go to `Preferences | Editor | Colors & Fonts` and select one of the new 
color themes.

Note About Fonts
-----------------
Unfortunately, font settings are included in the color settings files.
You should probably modify these in `Preferences | Editor | Colors & Fonts | Font`
after adding the color schemes to your IntelliJ IDEA installation.
