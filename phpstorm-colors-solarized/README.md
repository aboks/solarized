================================================

Koen Lageveen <info@koenlageveen.nl>

Installation
------------

### Option 1: Manual installation

1.  Copy `Solarized Dark.xml` and `Solarized Light.xml` to your PhpStorm preferences:
On Windows it is in `C:\Users\<username>\.WebIde40\config\colors`.
        
2. Restart PhpStorm

3. Go to `Preferences | Editor | Colors & Fonts` and select one of the new color themes.

Note About Fonts
-----------------
Unfortunately, font settings are included in the color settings files. It is currently set to Consolas.
You should probably modify these in `Preferences | Editor | Colors & Fonts | Font` after adding the color schemes.
